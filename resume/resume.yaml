    startDate: 2022-10-01
    endDate: 2023-12-28
    highlights:
      - Research and implement internal data platform v2, with CI/CD for integration and unit tests, dependencies and code changes
      - Use Terraform with Infracost to asses infrastructure cost to prune unused/underutilized resources, in turn reduce 33% of cloud cost per month (FinOps)
      - Design and implement end-to-end cloud-native application deployment (Terraform for infra/secrets, Helm for application deployment, GitHub Actions
        for CI/CD, Kubernetes for container orchestration)
      - "Lead a major core product refactoring across ops, engineering and data (data engineering, data science and machine learning engineering). Affected
        areas: data pipelines, model training pipelines, real-time inference endpoints, database performance optimization, deployment pipelines, local development
        workflow"
      - Lead a cloud migration from AWS to GCP
      - Introduce H3 spatial indexing to improve spatial queries performance. This also allows any system to obtain the performance gain, since it is not
        tied to execution engine with spatial support
