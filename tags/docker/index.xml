      <description>Imagine working in a company, and they have a super cool internal module! The module works great, except that it is a private module, which means you need to install it by cloning the source repo and install it from source.
That shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be an issue if you work on your local machine. But for production usually this means you somehow need to bundle this awesome module into your docker image.</description>

      <description>For data that doesn&amp;rsquo;t fit into memory, spark is often a recommended solution, since it can utilize map-reduce to work with data in a distributed manner. However, setting up local spark development from scratch involves multiple steps, and definitely not for a faint of heart. Thankfully using docker means you can skip a lot of steps ðŸ˜ƒ
Instructions Install Docker Desktop Create docker-compose.yml in a directory somewhere version: &amp;#34;3.3&amp;#34; services: pyspark: container_name: pyspark image: jupyter/pyspark-notebook:latest ports: - &amp;#34;8888:8888&amp;#34; volumes: - .</description>

      <description>Creating scripts are easy. But creating a small docker image is not ðŸ˜….
Not all Linux flavors are created equal, some are bigger than others, etc. But this difference is very crucial when it comes to reducing docker image size.
A simple bash script docker image Given a Dockerfile (change apk to apt for ubuntu):
FROM alpine:3 WORKDIR /app RUN apk update &amp;amp;&amp;amp; apk add jq curl COPY water-cut-notify.sh ./ ENTRYPOINT [&amp;#34;sh&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;/app/water-cut-notify.</description>
