EDIT: see [here]({{< ref "/posts/2021/hello-caddy" >}}) for Caddy, also easier to set up too.

Sometimes you found an interesting project to self-hosted, but it doesn't have password authentication built-in. Luckily, we need to reverse-proxy them anyway and apache2/ nginx / httpd happen to provide password auth with reverse-proxy by default.

To set up password auth with apache2 via reverse-proxy:

1. `echo "${PASSWORD}" | htpasswd -c -i /etc/apache2/.htpasswd ${USER}` on your host machine which has apache2 installed.
2. create a vhost config:

```xml
<VirtualHost *:80>
    ProxyPreserveHost On

    ProxyPass / http://localhost:${EXPOSED_CONTAINER_PORT}/
    ProxyPassReverse / http://localhost:${EXPOSED_CONTAINER_PORT}/

    ServerName ${YOUR_DOMAIN}

    <Proxy *>
        Order deny,allow
        Allow from all
        Authtype Basic
        Authname "Password Required"
        AuthUserFile /etc/apache2/.htpasswd
        Require valid-user
    </Proxy>
</virtualhost>
```

That's it!
