Creating scripts are easy. But creating a small docker image is not ðŸ˜….

Not all Linux flavors are created equal, some are bigger than others, etc. But this difference is very crucial when it comes to reducing docker image size.

## A simple bash script docker image

Given a Dockerfile (change `apk` to `apt` for `ubuntu`):

```dockerfile
FROM alpine:3

WORKDIR /app

RUN apk update && apk add jq curl

COPY water-cut-notify.sh ./

ENTRYPOINT ["sh", "/app/water-cut-notify.sh"]
```

| Base image | Docker image size |
| ---------- | ----------------- |
| alpine     | 11.1MB            |
| ubuntu     | 122MB             |

Ubuntu image size is `1099%` larger!!!!!!

## What about a light python image?

```dockerfile
FROM python:3.9-alpine

WORKDIR /app

RUN pip install requests
```

| Base image | Docker image size |
| ---------- | ----------------- |
| alpine     | 53.6MB            |
| ubuntu     | 920MB             |

Ubuntu image size is `1716%` larger!!!!!!

## Should you use alpine image for everything?

From above two experiments, we get:

It's obvious that alpine has a very significant lighter footprint than ubuntu. But don't use alpine image for everything. For bash and go, using alpine results in lighter footprint. But for python apps, it's better to go with debian-based images. This [article](https://pythonspeed.com/articles/alpine-docker-python/) explains in details why it's so.
