<!--- ![me-at-grill-the-data](/about/me-at-grill-the-data.jpg) -->

I'm currently a platform engineer at [Data Cafe (Thailand)](https://www.datacafethailand.com/).

Previously I was a Data Engineer, Machine Learning Engineer and Site Reliability Engineer. Before that I was doing IT Support and System Administration.

My expertise lies in the realms of data engineering, machine learning, and devops, where I optimize processes and drive impactful projects.

Apart from my professional pursuits, I actively contribute to tech & data communities and open-source projects.

When I have lessons to share I enjoy speaking at conferences.

Surprisingly, I do enjoy cooking a lot, but not as much as tinkering with my [homelab](https://github.com/kahnwong/self-hosted).

Iâ€™m probably listening to symphonic heavy metal.

Many people wonder what I do, because I seem to hang out in a lot of communities, to which I tell them it's DevSecMLFinDataOps ðŸ˜ƒ.

Fun fact: [this dude](https://faithstory.info/) stole my homelab configuration, but I already picked his brain for management and leadership skills ðŸ«¢.
