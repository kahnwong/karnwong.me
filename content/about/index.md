<!--- ![me-at-grill-the-data](/about/me-at-grill-the-data.jpg) -->

I'm currently the Head of Platform Engineering at Baania. Our mission is to be the leader in Thailand's property data. The best part about this role is I get to work with [this dude](https://faithstory.info/)!

Previously I was a Data Engineer, Machine Learning Engineer and Site Reliability Engineer. Before that I was doing IT Support and System Administration.

My expertise lies in the realms of data engineering, machine learning, and devops, where I optimize processes and drive impactful projects.

Apart from my professional pursuits, I actively contribute to tech & data communities and open-source projects.

When I have lessons to share I enjoy speaking at conferences.

Surprisingly, I do enjoy cooking a lot, but not as much as tinkering with my homelab.

Iâ€™m probably listening to symphonic heavy metal.

And unsurprisingly, our tech team recognized me as DevSecMLFinDataOps.
