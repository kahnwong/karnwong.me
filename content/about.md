I currently hold the position of Head of Platform Engineering at Baania. My expertise lies in the realms of data engineering, machine learning, and devops, where I work diligently to optimize processes and drive impactful projects. At Baania, I've had the pleasure of automating deployments, managing secrets, and improving the performance of complex pipelines.

Apart from my professional pursuits, I actively contribute to tech & data communities and open-source projects.

If you're interested in platform engineering or would like to connect for potential collaborations, I'm excited to engage with you. Let's discuss and uncover opportunities for innovation together. Cheers!
