I started out as an IT support, then pick up DevOps through self-hosting and software engineering during school years. I have been involved in every step in a machine learning project workflow from r&d to production. Currently I am a platform engineer at [Baania](https://baaniathailand.com). If you are in Bangkok, you might see me at a local meetup ðŸ˜Ž.
